## Meetings

- An ex-member can still see a departed club's forward schedule. `userMemberIds` deliberately ignores `members.status`, and the deactivation sweep in `members-logic.ts` skips slots on CANCELLED meetings, while `applyReopenMeeting` restores a meeting without clearing assignments. Cancel a meeting, deactivate a member, reopen it, and their `/me` shows that club's date, theme and location with a Release button that dead-ends. Needs all three steps, so it is debt rather than scheduled work.
  **Priority:** P4

## Tooling

- `bun run fix` writes the whole tree, and there is no scoped variant. Fine today (it is a verified no-op on a clean tree), but two things make a scoped one worth having before anyone wires it into a hook: `biome check --changed` hard-errors here because `biome.json`'s `vcs` block has no `defaultBranch`, and a `pre-commit` hook running the unscoped `fix` would sweep unrelated working-tree drift into the commit. `--staged` is verified working, so `"fix:staged": "biome check --write --staged"` plus `"defaultBranch": "main"` in the `vcs` block would close both.
  **Priority:** P4

- Biome's `files.includes` covers `src/**`, `.vscode/**`, `index.html` and `vite.config.ts` only, so `scripts/**`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts` and the whole `extension/` sub-package are outside the gate entirely. `extension/` has no Biome config and no Biome step in its CI job, yet some plans instruct running Biome from inside it, where it resolves the root config that excludes those paths. Decide whether those paths should be linted or explicitly declared out of scope.
  **Priority:** P4

## Agenda

- Confirm the hand-off rows on a real MCF agenda after it deploys — that the four print layouts read right in the room and the projected deck's hand-off slides land where the cue is needed.
  **Priority:** P3

- `scripts/measure-word-poster.ts` has no tests because `main()` runs at import, so nothing is reachable. It is the harness that derives the Word of the Day poster's font-size tables, and a wrong result there ships mid-word breaks on a wall poster. `scripts/import-agendas-logic.ts` is the repo's precedent for extracting a testable `*-logic.ts` alongside an entry-point script.
  **Priority:** P4

## Print & artifacts

- `public/role-sheets/*.pdf` are committed artifacts rendered from `src/server/role-sheet-layout.ts`, and nothing regenerates or verifies them. `scripts/build-role-sheets.ts` claims the shared layout means the blank and pre-filled sheets "can't drift" — they did: the amber to yellow rename (#507) changed the live sheet and left the committed PDFs printing "Amber" until a reviewer read the bytes. `build:role-sheets` exists but is not in CI. v1.4.1.0 added tests that assert the printed WORDS on both the agenda and the Timer sheet, so a rename can no longer pass silently — but nothing still re-renders the committed PDFs, so a layout change that does not touch wording can still leave them stale. A CI step that re-renders and diffs the committed bytes would make the claim true. v1.5.0.0 added a page-COUNT gate (`role-sheet-layout.test.ts` re-renders each sheet with and without a logo and asserts one page, verified by forcing a 900pt logo to two pages), which closes the overflow case specifically — a byte-diff against the committed artifacts is still the open half.
  **Priority:** P3

- The canonical meeting page (`club.$clubId.meeting.$meetingId.tsx`) is the one logo-supplying loader with no test on its `logoUrl` wiring. v1.5.0.0 covered the two standalone public print routes after a coverage audit forced all four loaders to null and the whole suite stayed green; this one was left because the route imports enough that isolating it needs more mocking than the other two. Its only logo consumer is the `.pptx` button, so the blast radius is one surface — but it is the same seam, untested.
  **Priority:** P4

## Guests & identity

- `members_club_idx` is now a strict prefix of `members_club_person_unique` and serves no query the composite cannot, so it is dead weight on every members write. Dropping it is a follow-up migration; `members_person_idx` must stay (person_id is the trailing column and `people-merge-logic.ts` looks up by person alone).
  **Priority:** P4

- `PHONE_CANDIDATE_LIMIT = 50` is untested on both dedup scans — shrinking it to 3 is invisible to the suite. Pinning it needs 51 same-phone rows with the only agreeing row sorting last, which is a slow fixture for a documented-and-safe overrun (the cap can only ever mean "no match", which creates a fresh Person).
  **Priority:** P4

## Completed

<!-- Items move here with: **Completed:** vX.Y.Z.W (YYYY-MM-DD) -->

- The MCF handback beat ("Toastmaster of the Day · Introduces the speakers") has no counterpart slide in the projected deck, so a Toastmaster running the meeting off the projector alone does not see the cue.
  **Priority:** P4
  **Completed:** v1.1.0.0 (2026-07-29) — every hand-off now has a matching slide, labelled by target.
