# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository. This file describes the ACTUAL
stack — follow it over any generic defaults.

## Git worktree isolation (required)

We run many issues in parallel. NEVER edit or commit directly in the main
checkout (on `main` or a local branch) — parallel sessions sharing one
checkout corrupt each other's work. Before any file edit or commit, create
and enter a dedicated git worktree (`git worktree add`). Exceptions:
read-only/inspection tasks, or when the human explicitly says to edit in place.

## Stack

- **TanStack Start** (React 19, SSR via Nitro), file-based routing under `src/routes/`.
- **Vite** is the bundler/dev server. Use it. Do NOT replace it with Bun.serve or HTML imports.
- **Drizzle ORM** on **PostgreSQL** via `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` (the `pg` driver).
  The db client is exported from `src/db/index.ts`; schema lives in `src/db/schema.ts`.
  Keep using `pg` / node-postgres — do NOT switch to Bun.sql or postgres.js.
- **Better-Auth** for authentication (`src/lib/auth.ts`), mounted at `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts`
  via the `server.handlers` pattern. **Magic-link is the only** sign-in method: `src/lib/auth.ts`
  uses the Better-Auth `magicLink` plugin with the Drizzle adapter (`drizzleAdapter(db, { provider: "pg" })`)
  and the `tanstackStartCookies` plugin — no email+password, no OAuth. Magic-link delivery is
  still stubbed: `sendMagicLink` only `console.log`s the URL, so a real email provider (Resend/SES)
  must be wired before production (tracked as a pre-launch issue). The React client is
  `src/lib/auth-client.ts` (`authClient.useSession()` / `signOut()`, see
  `src/integrations/better-auth/header-user.tsx`).
- **TanStack Query** for client data, SSR-integrated (`src/integrations/tanstack-query/`,
  wired as router context in `src/router.tsx`).
- **shadcn/ui** + **Tailwind CSS v4** (config-less, via `@tailwindcss/vite`; styles in
  `src/styles.css`). Add components with `bunx shadcn@latest add <name>` → `src/components/ui`.
  Icons from `lucide-react`.
- **Biome** for lint/format. **Vitest** for tests. **TypeScript strict.**

## Commands

Package manager is **Bun** (use `bun install`, `bun run <script>`).

- `bun run dev` — dev server on port 3000.
- `bun run check` — Biome lint + format gate. (`bun run lint` / `bun run format` individually.)
- `bun run test` — Vitest (uses Vitest, NOT `bun test`).
- `bun run db:generate` — generate Drizzle migrations from `src/db/schema.ts`.
- `bun run db:migrate` — apply migrations. `db:push` for dev sync, `db:studio` to inspect.
- `bun run generate-routes` — regenerate `src/routeTree.gen.ts` (also runs during dev/build).
- `bun run build` — Vite build (Node server output via Nitro).
- There is no dedicated typecheck script — `bun run build` (or `bunx tsc --noEmit`) surfaces type errors.
- Run a single test with `bunx vitest run <path>` (or `bunx vitest <path>` to watch).

## Environment

Local env goes in `.env.local` (loaded by `drizzle.config.ts` via dotenv and by the dev script).
Required: `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres connection string), `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.

## Conventions

- **Import alias:** prefer `#/*` → `src/*` (e.g. `import { db } from "#/db"`). `@/*` also maps to
  `src/*` (used by shadcn's `components.json`), but `#/*` is the one declared in `package.json` imports.
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` and `src/styles.css` are excluded from Biome — never hand-edit the route tree.
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` is the app shell (providers, devtools, `<head>`).
- API routes use the `server.handlers` pattern (see `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts`).
- Strict TS includes no-unused-locals/params — unused symbols fail the build.
- Biome formats with **tabs** and **double quotes**, with import organization on.

## Data layer

Schema is `src/db/schema.ts` (a single `todos` table so far — this is an early scaffold).
The `db` client (`src/db/index.ts`) is `drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!, { schema })`.
Migrations are generated to `./drizzle` (`drizzle.config.ts`); edit the schema, then
`bun run db:generate` + `bun run db:migrate` (or `db:push` for quick dev sync).

## Deployment target

**Railway** (managed container PaaS) — see `docs/adr/0007-railway-managed-paas.md` (supersedes
ADR-0003). Push to `main` auto-deploys; env vars are set in the Railway dashboard; Postgres is
Railway's managed plugin (provides `DATABASE_URL`). This keeps the **single Node-server model**:
the Nitro `node-server` build (`.output/server/index.mjs`) and the `node-postgres` pool in
`src/db/index.ts` are unchanged. Migrations run on deploy via `bun run db:migrate`.
Do NOT adopt edge/serverless adapters (Cloudflare Workers / Convex) — the persistent process is
required for the `pg` pool and the planned in-process reminder poller (#7). The Workers + Neon
path stays a deferred future option only.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live as GitHub issues in `abustamam/tm-scheduler` (managed via the `gh` CLI); external PRs are not a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical label vocabulary, unchanged: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root (created lazily by `/domain-modeling`). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
