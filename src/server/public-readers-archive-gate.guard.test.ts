/**
 * Wiring guard for the public archive gate (#544).
 *
 * `public-readers-archive-gate.integration.test.ts` proves each gated SEAM
 * refuses an archived club. It cannot prove the `createServerFn` handlers
 * actually CALL those seams — a handler body needs the Start runtime, so no
 * test in this repo can execute one. That is the same blind spot #319 shipped
 * through: `VisitCta` and `AboutClub` were both well covered and the bug was in
 * neither, because the defect was the expression at the CALL SITE.
 *
 * Here the gap is unusually easy to fall into, because the safe and the unsafe
 * function are INTERCHANGEABLE:
 *
 *     resolveMeetingKey(clubId, key)        // no archive check
 *     resolvePublicMeetingKey(clubId, key)  // archive-gated
 *
 * Identical signatures, identical return type. Swapping one for the other
 * typechecks, passes lint, and leaves all 14 integration cases green — they
 * exercise the seam directly and never touch the handler. The same holds for
 * `listRoleDefinitions` vs `loadPublicClubRoles` and for the two extractions
 * this change made (`loadPublicClubRoster`, `loadUpcomingMeetings`), whose
 * whole point was to move a query somewhere a test can reach.
 *
 * So this guard pins the wiring: every PUBLIC server fn below must call its
 * gated seam, and must not call the ungated sibling.
 *
 * READ MODE — comment-blind (`readSource`), deliberately. The load-bearing half
 * of each case is "this call must BE present", and per `src/test/guard-source.ts`
 * that form is BYPASSED by a comment merely naming the function: a handler could
 * be rewired to the ungated call while a comment above it still said
 * `loadPublicClubRoster`, and a raw read would report clean. The "must not call"
 * half then rides on the same stripped text, which costs only the ability to
 * fail on a comment — a real call is code, never a comment, so nothing that
 * matters goes unseen.
