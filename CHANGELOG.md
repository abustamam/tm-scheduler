# Changelog

Notable changes to GavelUp, newest first. Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` and match the `VERSION` file; `/ship` writes an entry per release.

## [1.1.0.0] - 2026-07-29

The agenda now tells the room who hands off to whom. Running a meeting off it, nobody had to guess whose cue it was.

### Added

- **Hand-off rows.** Four new rows name who introduces whom, each with the holder's name on it: the Toastmaster introduces the speakers and the Table Topics Master, the Table Topics Master hands over to the General Evaluator, and the General Evaluator introduces the speech evaluators. A fifth appears at clubs where the General Evaluator opens the meeting. They cost no clock time, because the time was always inside the segment either side of them. Three more transitions read as a clause on the row that owns them: the Sergeant-at-Arms introduces the President, the General Evaluator returns control to the Toastmaster, and the Toastmaster hands over to the President.
- **Hand-offs on the projected deck.** Each hand-off has a matching slide, so whoever is on deck sees their cue on the wall at the moment they need it. The jump-to-slide grid labels them by target rather than as identical rows.
- **Cover for a missing General Evaluator.** A club that runs no General Evaluator now has the Toastmaster of the Day take the whole role: introducing the functionaries, introducing the speech evaluators, calling for the Timer's report, evaluating the evaluators, calling for the functionary reports, and giving the overall evaluation. Before this, a club with functionaries but no General Evaluator never called for the functionary reports at all, so the Timer, Ah-Counter and Grammarian were never cued to report.

### Changed

- **The segment leader calls for the vote, not the Timer.** Every "call for the Timer's report and open voting" row now belongs to whoever is running that segment, with their name on it. It used to name the Timer, so the person who actually had to ask for the report got no cue.
- **The awards row names who presents them.** It was an unattributed "Toastmaster", a role that does not exist under that name.
- **Wording.** The Call to Order no longer mentions exits, the President's closing reads "announcements" rather than "elections" because clubs hold no elections at a regular meeting, and vote rows read "opens voting for Best Speaker" to match the third-person narration of every other row.
- **The evaluator evaluation needs evaluators.** "Evaluates the evaluators" no longer prints for a club that runs none. This reverses an earlier decision that gated it on the General Evaluator instead.
- **Print layout.** Hand-offs render as a compact transition band rather than a full row, so the agenda gains the cues without gaining a page. On the grid layout the sheet now scales to about 95% to fit.

### Fixed

- A club whose role name contained certain punctuation could corrupt the surrounding text on the printed agenda.

## [1.0.0.0] - 2026-07-28

The first tracked version. GavelUp has been live with real clubs since June 2026 — this entry describes what it does today rather than replaying the ~440 pull requests that got it here, which stay in git history. Everything after this line is a change against this baseline.

### Added

- **Meetings and agendas.** Per-club role definitions and slots, a schedule builder, batch meeting creation, and a printable agenda whose run of show adapts to the roles a club actually runs. Table Topics flexes to absorb over- and under-runs so the printed clock matches the room.
- **Present mode.** A projected slide deck built from the same meeting data as the agenda, plus PowerPoint export, and four print layouts including grid and one-page timing sheets.
- **Public club pages.** Read-only by default, with a shared sign-up sheet guests and members can claim roles on without an account, a "can't go" decline chip, and a guest book.
- **Members and roster.** One Person per human across clubs, separate from per-club Membership, with CSV import, dedupe on write, and cross-club merge tools for superadmins.
- **Pathways.** Path enrollment, level and project progress, and a browser extension that syncs Base Camp progress into the app through per-club tokens.
- **Minutes.** Meeting minutes derived from the agenda and what actually happened, with per-meeting announcements.
- **Officer tools.** VPE and VP Membership dashboards, dues tracking, Distinguished Club Program tracking, an activity log, and a club switcher for people who serve more than one club.
- **Accounts.** Magic-link sign-in only, a superadmin allowlist reconciled on every sign-in, and read-write impersonation so a superadmin can act as a club admin.
- **Offline support.** A service worker keeps print and present views usable when the room's wifi is not.
